Welcome to **Launch Hunter**, a premium, highly interactive flight operations and telemetry console designed to look and feel like opening a mission control center at NASA or SpaceX Starbase. 

Unlike standard "list of cards" student templates, **Launch Hunter** is engineered as a real-time command dashboard complete with custom WebGL graphics, canvas charting loops, automated flight checklists, and a search console designed to capture recruiter attention immediately.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy & HUD Aesthetics

The design merges the styling cues of a military flight deck, sci-fi HUD telemetry, and modern premium glassmorphism interfaces:

*   **Color System**: Deep Space Void (`#020204`), Nebula Navy (`#090d1a`), and Cyber Slate (`#13192b`).
*   **Color Accents**: Neon Cyan (`#00f0ff`) representing active/online systems and telemetry feeds; Rocket Orange (`#ff6b00`) representing booster combustion and alerts.
*   **Visual Atmosphere**: 
    *   *Moving Starfields*: Lightweight keyframe particle animations.
    *   *Scanline Overlays*: Vertical looping grid filters representing high-contrast military CRT monitors.
    *   *Cyber Grid Backdrops*: Sleek coordinate lines mapping spatial alignment.
    *   *Tabular Figures*: Monospaced typography rules on numerical fields (timestamps, speeds, and coordinates) to prevent visual layout shifts during ticks.

## 🛰️ Core Feature Set

| Feature | Portfolio Impact Score | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Interactive 3D WebGL Globe** | **10/10** | Custom procedurally wireframed Earth globe built with vanilla Three.js. Maps global spaceports (Florida, Texas, India, Kourou), renders parabolic trajectory arches, and supports click details with draggable rotation controls. |
| **Telemetry Flight Desk Modal** | **9/10** | Clicking any mission opens a deep telemetry board featuring an interactive flight timeline checklist, current staging status indicators, and real-time velocity curves. |
| **Live Canvas Telemetry Charts** | **9/10** | High-performance HTML Canvas rendering loops plotting velocity/apogee curves. Supports interactive commands: **Initiate Flight** triggers staged climbs; **Abort Command** triggers emergency alerts and screen vibration shakes. |
| **Spotlight Command Search** | **8/10** | Global keyboard search overlay (`Cmd+K` or `Ctrl+K`) that searches upcoming manifests, historical databases, and rocket specs with instant match highlights. |
| **OS Boot Terminal Loader** | **8/10** | Immersive booting console that prints mock telemetry initialization logs, progress bars, and a rocket liftoff animation before entering the console dashboard. |
| **Rocket Fleet Gallery** | **7/10** | Glassmorphic specifications carousel containing detailed engineering specs (height, thrust, propellant type, stages, and payload capacity) for active fleets (Falcon 9, Starship, SLS). |
| **Mobile Dock Navigation** | **7/10** | Responsive floating bottom app bar optimized for mobile touch viewports, supporting smooth section anchor scrolling. |

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Dependencies

*   **Core Framework**: React 19 & Vite 8 (fast, modern ES module bundling)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 (incorporating `@tailwindcss/vite` for CSS variable compilation)
*   **Graphics Engine**: Three.js (WebGL 3D Earth)
*   **Animation**: Framer Motion (fluid spring-physics state transitions)
*   **Iconography**: Lucide React (aerospace vectors)
*   **Data Controller**: Fail-safe hybrid model that bridges remote API requests with offline mock datasets.

## 🌐 Production Deployment

Since the project builds into static assets, it can be deployed to **Netlify** or **Vercel** for free:

### Netlify Continuous Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
3. Click **Add new site** > **Import an existing project** > Select your **GitHub** repo.
4. Netlify will auto-detect Vite compile settings:
    *   **Build Command**: `npm run build`
    *   **Publish Directory**: `dist`
5. Click **Deploy**. Any future push to your `main` branch will automatically build and publish updates.
